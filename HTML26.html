<h3 style="font-family:Arial"> Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet".It's called the Red Planet because its iron-rich dust gives it landscape a rusty-red color. At the equator, Mars is a comfortable 80 degrees Fahrenheit, but the temperature at its poles can get down to 199 degrees below zero.Mars's gravity is 38 percent of Earth's.
